# HRMACT Sudoku Solver

A PyTorch implementation of the **Hierarchical Reasoning Model with Adaptive Computation Time (HRMACT)**, tailored for solving Sudoku puzzles using hierarchical abstract reasoning.

## Highlights

* Dual-mode hierarchical reasoning with **high-level planning** and **low-level detail**, inspired by HRM’s brain-like architecture ([sapientinc/HRM](https://github.com/sapientinc/HRM/tree/main)).
* **Adaptive Computation Time (ACT)** enables the model to dynamically decide when to halt reasoning.
* **Efficient training** using curriculum learning across Sudoku difficulty levels.
* Lightweight implementation delivers strong performance even with limited data.
* Built-in **CLI interface** modeled after Tanmay Bakshi’s Swift implementation ([tanmay-bakshi/HierarchicalReasoningModel](https://github.com/tanmay-bakshi/HierarchicalReasoningModel)).

This repository hosts checkpoints for the Hierarchical Reasoning Model with Adaptive Computation Time (HRMACT), trained on Sudoku puzzles.

* Training steps: 3,000
* Batch size: 512
* Total training time: \~18 hours
* Checkpoint format: `.safetensors`

📌 **Note**: The original HRM paper recommends training for **10,000+ steps** for best performance. These checkpoints are intended as a lightweight, educational reference.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have:

* Python 3.8+
* PyTorch (with MPS support for Apple Silicon, or CUDA for GPU users)
* `numpy`
* `safetensors`

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Training

```bash
python main.py train
```

* Trains the HRMACT model with curriculum learning across difficulty levels.
* Saves checkpoints every 250 steps (and on step 1) in `.safetensors` format.

### Inference

```bash
python main.py infer <checkpoint> <difficulty>
```

Example:

```bash
python main.py infer checkpoint-1000.safetensors hard
```

Arguments:

* `checkpoint`: Path to a saved model checkpoint (`.safetensors`).
* `difficulty`: One of `very-easy`, `easy`, `medium`, `hard`, `extreme`.

## Architecture

* **Model (`model.py`)**
  Hierarchical transformer layers with ACT head, rotary position embeddings, SwiGLU, and RMSNorm.

* **Training (`train.py`)**

  * Cross-entropy loss on blank Sudoku cells
  * Q-learning–style loss for the halting policy
  * Curriculum learning: training gradually shifts from easy to harder puzzles

* **Generation (`sudoku.py`)**
  Generates Sudoku puzzles with guaranteed unique solutions at chosen difficulty levels.
